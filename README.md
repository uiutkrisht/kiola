# Aligna â€“ Automated Figma vs Live Web QA

Aligna is a tool that helps you compare your live website against its Figma design, highlighting any mismatches in fonts, colors, spacing, layout, and images.

## Features

- Compare live website with Figma design
- Detect differences in:
  - Font properties (family, size, weight)
  - Colors
  - Spacing and layout
  - Images
- Visual comparison with side-by-side view
- Detailed difference report with severity levels
- Filter differences by type

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Figma access token
- Public Figma file URL
- Public website URL to compare

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aligna.git
cd aligna
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Figma access token:
```
FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

1. Enter your Figma file URL and live website URL in the input form
2. Click "Compare" to start the analysis
3. View the results:
   - Side-by-side visual comparison
   - List of differences with details
   - Filter differences by type
   - Severity indicators for each difference
